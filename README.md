Ruby Tests
===

A quick way to get up and running with tests.

Bundle via the gemfile to get:

* [Shoulda-Matches](https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda-matchers) (an improvement on default rspec syntax)
* [rspec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec) for running tests
* [guard](https://github.com/guard/) to watch directories.
* [guard-rspec](https://github.com/guard/guard-rspec) to watch directories.
